- Sodium Carbonate: Commonly known as washing soda or soda ash. Arm & Hammer in a nut shell. This is a alkalinity booster which will form our main base and bulk. This will make our detergent alkaline and act as a degreaser/saponifier with acidic flux compounds.
- Sodium Percarbonate: This is an oxygen based bleaching agent/oxidizer. It breaks down into sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide in water. Sodium carbonate is explained above. We want hydrogen peroxide because it removes organic stains. Rosin based fluxes can cause staining when burned, and also other organic compounds, like spilled dried soda, capacitor electrolytes, etc.
- Sodium Metasilicate: This is a strong base chemical which will boost alkalinity and increase degreasing action on the detergent. It complements the soda ash/sodium carbonate and also acts as a dispersing agent, preventing redeposition of dirt and grime onto PCB's during cavitation. It also acts as a corrosion inhibitor and helps soften water, e.g. tap water.
- Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (AKA Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate): This acts as a surfactant. Basically it lowers surface tension allowing the other chemicals to penetrate flux, dirt and grime deposits more easily.
